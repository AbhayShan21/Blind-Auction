# 🏛️ Blind Auction – Python Bidding Game

A classic “highest bid wins” setup, built as part of the **100 Days of Python** challenge.  
No cheating, no peeking — just old-school blind bidding like real auctions used to run.

---

## 🎯 How It Works
- Each bidder types their **name** and **bid amount** privately.  
- Program stores all bids in a dictionary.  
- When bidding ends, Python finds the **highest bidder** and declares the winner.  

Simple, fair, traditional. Straight to the point.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Storing key–value pairs using dictionaries  
- Loops for repeated user input  
- Comparing values to find a max  
- Writing clean, modular code  
- Respecting the original auction logic
